# GIST-paper

This repository contains the code to reproduce the Figures and Results from Zubair et al, 2022. The data required by the scripts in this repository are too large to host on GitHub and have thus been uploaded to Open Science Framework and is available at the following link: https://osf.io/u79fc/
 
The scripts are structured by Figures (i.e. Fig. 2 â€¦ Fig. 5). This manuscript is in review and a preprint is available here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.10.468082v1
